# cmsc858d-hw
Homeworks for CMSC858D: Algorithms, Data Structures and Inference for High-throughput Genomics (Spring 2022)

Each task can be executed by running the following in command line, once navigated to the `homework1` folder. This example is for task_1 (replace `task_1` with `task_2` or `task_3` for the other tasks):
```
cd task_1
mkdir task_1_build
cd task_1_build
cmake ../
cmake --build .
./task_1
```

Tasks 1 and 2 have a command line interface, but task 3 does not.
